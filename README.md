# ForgeRock DevOps and Cloud Deployment - Open Banking Accelerator Demo

This repository contains a demonstration deployment of the ForgeRock platform along with the ForgeRock Open Banking Accelerators. These accelerators are a set of plugins and configuration for meeting the UK Open Banking requirements, based on the [PSD2 Accelerator assets](https://github.com/ForgeRock/PSD2-Accelerators/tree/OpenBankingAccelerators).

The deployment is based on the [ForgeRock Cloud Developer Kit (CDK)](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/7/index-forgeops.html) kubernetes deployment model.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create namespaces
kubectl create namespace obdemo-iam
kubectl create namespace obdemo-bank

# Initialise config
bin/config.sh init --profile obdemo-iam --version 7.0
bin/config.sh init --profile obdemo-bank --version 7.0

# DNS
sudo echo $(minikube ip) default.iam.example.com >> /etc/hosts
sudo echo $(minikube ip) default.bank.example.com >> /etc/hosts

# Start up 
skaffold run -p obdemo-iam
skaffold run -p obdemo-bank
```

## ForgeOps Deltas

This deployment is based on the ForgeOps Cloud Developer Kit, with the following modifications and additions:

- There is a new kustomize overlay at `kustomize/overlay/7.0/obdemo-iam`. The default `skaffold.yaml` file has a profile `obdemo-iam` pointing to this overlay.
- There is a new kustomize overlay at `kustomize/overlay/7.0/obdemo-bank`. The default `skaffold.yaml` file has a profile `obdemo-bank` pointing to this overlay.
- There is an additional deployment for the AM remote consent service front end (`docker/obdemo-rcs-ui`).
- There is an additional deployment for the AM remote consent service back end (`docker/obdemo-rcs-api`).
- There is an additional deployment for a demo resource server providing a mock bank API (`docker/obdemo-rs`).
- The IG deployment (`docker/7.0/ig`) has been modified to include a jar file with custom filters.
- The AM deployment (`docker/7.0/am`) has been modified to include a jar file with a custom scope validator.
- The configuration script `bin/config.sh` has been updated to handle amster export of dynamic configuration for subrealms.
- The ldif-importer task (`docker/7.0/ldif-importer`) has been updated with a modified `external-am-datastore.ldif` file to support dynamic configuration of subrealms.
- The AM Dockerfile has been updated to reduce the JVM memory allocation to 50% of container memory
- The IG configuration has been updated to increase the vertx max client header size to 16k

## Postman Collection

This repository includes a [Postman Collection](postman) for testing the deployment. Required steps for testing are as follows

- Enrol for an account at the [OBRI Directory](https://directory.ob.forgerock.financial)
- From the Directory dashboard, create a new software statement, and download the transport certificate and private key
- Configure Postman to use this client certificate and key for the hosts `default.iam.example.com`, `jwkms.ob.forgerock.financial` and `matls.service.directory.ob.forgerock.financial`

If you changed the FQDN value for the deployment, change the FQDN variable in the provided Postman environment, and define this host for client certificates as above.
