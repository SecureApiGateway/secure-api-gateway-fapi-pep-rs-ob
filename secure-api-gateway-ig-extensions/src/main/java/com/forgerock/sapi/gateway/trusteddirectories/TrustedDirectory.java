 * Sandbox Directory. It is trusted by both the ApiClient and the ApiProvider. In other eco-systems the registry will
 * be different. In some cases it can be a registry provided by the ApiProvider. For example a bank wishing to provide
 * innovative new custom APIs outside of a regulated system could create their own Trusted Registry.
