 * A Trusted Directory is an external 'trust anchor' that the Secure API Gateway should trust to be the issuer

 * configuration information for a trusted directory. In the UK this is the Open Banking Directory, or the Open Banking
 * Sandbox Directory. It is trusted by both the ApiClient and the ApiProvider. In other eco-systems the registry will
 * be different. In some cases it can be a registry provided by the ApiProvider. For example a bank wishing to provide
 * innovative new custom APIs outside of a regulated system could create their own Trusted Registry.
